# DPY Anti-Spam
---

Ever felt the need to handle spammers in your discord, but don't have the time or effort to do so yourself? 
This package aims to help solve that issue by handling all the required logic under the hood, as well as handling the spammers heh.

*I decided to create this after seeing a d.js alternative but not one for d.py as far as I know.*

> This is still definitely in early development stages.

### Build Ideology:
- OOP approach (Rip your ram ;)
- Scaleable (Multi guild support out of the box)
- Test Driven

I hope to maintain the above, however, I currently am attempting to `only` create a `working version`. After such is created, I will begin optimizations, code refactoring and general improvements.
